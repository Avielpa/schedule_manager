# Project Name: Schedule Management System

## High-Level Overview

This project is a Django-based web application for managing and automating soldier schedules. It uses a sophisticated algorithm to generate fair and balanced schedules based on a set of constraints and preferences. The system is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different scheduling needs.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main components: a Django web application for managing data and a powerful scheduling algorithm for generating schedules.

### Django Web Application

The Django application is responsible for the following:

-   **Data Management:** It provides a web interface for managing soldiers, constraints, and other scheduling-related data.
-   **API:** It exposes a RESTful API for interacting with the scheduling algorithm and other parts of the system.
-   **User Interface:** It provides a user-friendly interface for viewing and interacting with the generated schedules.

### Scheduling Algorithm

The scheduling algorithm is the core of the system. It is responsible for the following:

-   **Constraint Satisfaction:** It uses a constraint satisfaction solver to find optimal schedules that satisfy all the given constraints.
-   **Fairness and Balance:** It includes a set of fairness and balance objectives to ensure that the generated schedules are fair and balanced for all soldiers.
-   **Flexibility:** It is designed to be flexible and adaptable to different scheduling needs.

## How to Use the Project

To use the project, you will need to have Python and Django installed on your system. You will also need to have a basic understanding of how to work with Django projects.

### Installation

1.  Clone the project from the repository.
2.  Install the required dependencies using pip.
3.  Run the Django development server.

### Usage

1.  Access the web interface in your browser.
2.  Use the interface to manage soldiers, constraints, and other scheduling-related data.
3.  Use the API to interact with the scheduling algorithm and generate schedules.
4.  View and interact with the generated schedules in the user interface.

## File-by-File Explanation

### `manage.py`

This is a command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project in various ways. You can use it to run the development server, run tests, and perform other administrative tasks.

### `schedule_manage/settings.py`

This file contains the settings for the Django project. It includes settings for the database, installed apps, middleware, and other project-level configurations.

### `schedule/models.py`

This file defines the data models for the `schedule` app. It includes models for soldiers, constraints, scheduling runs, and other scheduling-related data.

### `schedule/views.py`

This file contains the views for the `schedule` app. It includes views for handling API requests, rendering templates, and other view-related logic.

### `schedule/algorithms/algorithms.py`

This file contains the implementation of the scheduling algorithm. It includes the logic for constraint satisfaction, fairness and balance, and other algorithm-related functionality.
